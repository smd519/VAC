People of all ages can be infected by the new
coronavirus (nCoV-2019).

Older people, and people with pre-existing
medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes,
heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to
becoming severely ill with the virus.

WHO advise people of all age to take steps to
protect themselves from the virus, for example
by following good hand hygiene and good
respiratory hygiene.

Does the new
coronavirus affect
older people, or are
younger people
also susceptible?
