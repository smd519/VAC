From the evidence so far, the new coronavirus
can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including
areas with hot and humid weather.
Regardless of climate, adopt protective
measures if you live in, or travel to an area
reporting COVlD-19.

The best way to protect yourself against
COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your
hands. Eliminate viruses that may be on your
hands and avoid infection that could occur by
then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.
