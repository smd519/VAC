The Government of Canada is asking that all travellers have a removable
non-medical mask or face covering large enough to cover their mouth
and nose during their travel through Canadian airports and in-flight.

Travellers must confirm that they have in their possession the mandatory
non-medical mask or face covering as part of the registration or check-in
process otherwise they will not be allowed to continue on theirjourney.
